Berti.\r\nHere are a few of my recent project completed during my traini\r\n\r\n## [Travel Posts](http://travelposts.herokuapp.com/)<img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/9632114682_9713aa5741.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 50px;\" align=\"left\"/>\r\n\r\nThis is a simple app that works both on mobile devices and desktop machines, that allows users to read and post comments based on geolocation.  The backend is build in Ruby on Rails, and uses postgresql and ActiveRecord for the database.  The mapping is done in leaflet and the majority of interactivity is built on the front end using jQuery.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [In Peak Season](http://inpeakseason.herokuapp.com/)\r\nThis project was inspired by my experience of great seasonal food during my travels overseas.  Most cultures in the world source food locally, and their regional recipes are built on these ingredients and are only prepared in season.  I wanted to build a tool to help us do the same here.  \r\n\r\nThis app locates the user's geolocation, and then looks up all local food items that are in season near the user.  Then the user can research recipes that use those ingredients, and find the nearest farmers markets so they can buy what they need right away.   The app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
