{"name":"Project22.github.io","tagline":"My Portfolio ","body":"### Portfolio site for J.P. Berti.\r\nHere are a few of my recent project completed during my traini\r\n\r\n[Travel Posts](http://travelposts.herokuapp.com/)\r\n```\r\nThis is a simple app that works both on mobile devices and desktop machines, that allows users to read and post comments based on geolocation.  The backend is build in Ruby on Rails, and uses postgresql and ActiveRecord for the database.  The mapping is done in leaflet and the majority of interactivity is built on the front end using jQuery.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[In Peak Season](http://inpeakseason.herokuapp.com/)\r\n```\r\nThis project was inspired by my experience of great seasonal food during my travels overseas.  Most cultures in the world source food locally, and their regional recipes are built on these ingredients and are only prepared in season.  I wanted to build a tool to help us do the same here.  \r\n\r\nThis app locates the user's geolocation, and then looks up all local food items that are in season near the user.  Then the user can research recipes that use those ingredients, and find the nearest farmers markets so they can buy what they need right away.   The app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
