<p>This is a simple app that works well on both mobile and on the desktop.  It allows users to read and post comments based on geolocation, and view images taken near to location.</p>
<p>
The backend is build in Ruby on Rails, and uses postgresql and ActiveRecord for the database.  The mapping is done in Leaflet and the majority of interactivity is built on the front end using jQuery and Bootstrap UI framework.</p>

<p>This project was inspired by my experience of great seasonal food during my travels overseas.  Most cultures in the world source food locally and seasonally. Their recipes are built on these ingredients, and are only prepared in season.  I wanted to build a tool to help us do the same here.  </p>

<p>This app locates the user's geolocation, and then looks up all local food items that are in season nearby.  The user can then find recipes that use those ingredients, and find the nearest farmers markets to buy at.   The app is responsive design, and also works well on mobile devices.</p>

<p>This is a fun remake of the popular Pictionary game.  It allows users on mobile and desktop devices to participate in a real-time online picture guessing contest.  One players draws, in real-time, and anyone visiting the site can watch and submit their guess of what it is.  The winning guesser gets the canvas, and draws the next round.</p>

<p>The application is built using the new AngularJS MVC framework from Google, and does real-time data syncronization using Firebase and Angularfire.</p>
